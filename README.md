# Challenge 13 - E-commerce Back-End

## Project Purpose

To create an e-commerce backend that allows a RESTful API the ability to perform CRUD operations.

## App Built With

- JavaScript ES6 / ES2015
- Node.js
- Express.js
- npm
- MySQL
- MySQL2 (npm package)
- Sequelize (npm package)
- Dotenv (npm package)

## Usage

Type "npm i" to install dependencies. Fill out your .env variables for your MySQL connection, as well as update config/connection.js if necessary. Source the db/schema.sql file into your MySQL console to setup the database. Then, seed the database, type "npm run seed" from within the app directory. Finally, type "npm start" to begin the application. You may use any CRUD operaions to /api/products, /api/products/:id, /api/categories, /api/categories/:id, /api/tags, and /api/tags/:id.
